Nokia Notifications API samples for Nokia X
===========================================

This project contains the simple examples demonstrating how to implement and
port an application to utilise Nokia Notifications on Nokia X software platform.

What are the samples all about:

* **GCM wrapper sample**: Aimed for those porting their apps utilising the GCM
  helper library in their project. The sample provides `com.google.android.gcm`
  package matching the namespace in the helper library.
* **Helper library sample**: Uses the Nokia Notifications helper library
  (`push.jar`) to communicate with the Nokia Notifications service.
* **Single APK sample**: Demonstrates how to implement a support for more than
  one notification services, in this case Nokia Notifications and Google Cloud
  Messaging (GCM) APIs, in a single project.

See the sample specific README and license files, located in the root folder of
each sample, for more details.
